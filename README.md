# NeunetCode
Neural network program in c# for study.

Currently I am following a course on machine learning. The reason for writing my own program is because I am used to programming in c# and writing from scratch is the best way to understand the smallest details. And of course writing a program is fun! Please do not expect a fancy user interface. For the moment this is my private project but maybe this will grow to something for more general use.

The code is loosely based on this ebook from http://michaelnielsen.org/
