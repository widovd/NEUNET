# NeunetCode
User friendly program with a nice user interface for studying neural networks and learning algorithms.

Specification:
Windows Forms
c#
.net Framework 4.7.2

The math is based on this ebook:
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html
from:
http://michaelnielsen.org/

Specifically:
"A simple network to clasify handwriting digits."

The handwritten digits used in the program are from:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Follow the instructions and unzip the files to a local folder.
Run NEUNET and open the training and label files. This needs to be done only one time: NUENET stores the settings in an AppData folder.
Start with a new network, or edit an existing network.
The first layer MUST have 784 neurons because the images are 28 x 28 pixels!
The last layer MUST have 10 neurons, because there are 10 digits.
Optionally change the calculation settings.
Start learning the network.
Test the network using a subset of random samples.

The program is under development.

Good luck!
